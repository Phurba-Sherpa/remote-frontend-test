### Issues :pushpin:

If you happen to get blank map after the api fetch, then try adjusting zoom, I didn't get why map goes blank if you try to zoom in or zoom out. So, to see the map, please do one of the following steps
- Try using zoom in or zoom out button of the Overlay map.
- Try refreshing the page
- Inspect browser ```CTR + SHIFT + I ```. And may be try resizing the window using responsive dimensions.
